### Project 1 Report Overview & Requirements

For Project 1, I developed a professional profile website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and public APIs. The site includes sections for my profile, education, experience, skills, projects, and certificates. Key features include dynamic content updates via APIs (like WeatherBit for graphics and JokeAPI for jokes), and JavaScript cookies to personalize user visits. The website is deployed on GitHub Pages, showcasing my web development skills and understanding of secure programming practices. The project reinforced my ability to integrate various web technologies and enhanced my front-end development expertise.
In this project, I expanded my front-end web development skills by developing a Professional Profile Website and deploying it on the github.io cloud service. This project has general, non-technical, and technical requirements with grade distributions as follows.

### Task 1: Development & Environment Setup
I set up my development environment using Github.io and GitHub. I configured the necessary tools and created the initial repository to ensure a smooth workflow for the project. This setup provided a solid foundation for version control and collaboration. We were instructed to do this in a previous lecture which gave me a headstart as well.

### Task 2: Foundations of The Web
I learned the basic building blocks of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created simple web pages to practice these skills, which helped me understand the structure and styling of web content like using api's and bootstrap.

### Task 3: Front-end Web Development
I developed a professional profile website incorporating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a navigation bar, and sections for profile, education, experience, skills, projects, and certificates. This task enhanced my front-end development skills. It was very cool seeing all the work be brought to like in the web server.

### Task 4: Integrating Public APIs
I integrated the JokeAPI to display a programming joke and the WeatherBit API to display a comic image of the weather in Cincinnati as shown at the bottom of my website. This involved fetching data from the APIs and dynamically updating the webpage content. These integrations added interactive and dynamic elements to the site. For WeatherBit I received an API key and used that to get my code.

### Task 5: JavaScript Cookies
I implemented JavaScript cookies to remember user visits and display a welcome message accordingly. This personalization improves user experience by acknowledging repeat visits and providing a sense of continuity. Each time you visit my site, a pop-up window appears showcasing your last visit date and time.

### Task 6: Final Deployment
I deployed the website on GitHub.io Pages, ensuring all functionalities worked as expected. This step involved configuring the repository for deployment and verifying that all interactive features and API integrations function correctly on the live site. If you click my links that is where you will find all of my work. I also added the waph.html in my webserver as a secondary link that can be clicked and it will open a new tab for viewing.
